# HEARTH'S NEIGHBOR
![HEARTH'S NEIGHBOR LOGO](MiscArt/Logo.png)

The museum has an interesting alien plate on display in the back...now that you've got access to warp technology, perhaps you figure out where it came from?
To start the mod, find the new exhibit in the museum.

Made for the 2023 Outer Wilds Summer Jam
