MUSEUM PLATE
-The museum has an alien plate on display. While it doesn't seem to be Nomai in origin, its creator is unknown.
-The plate has a map of two solar systems carved on it. One is our system, but the other is a nearby system, Hearth's Neighbor. With a warp drive in one's ship, one could warp to that system and check it out.
-[After watching ending cutscene]The plate was left by the sole survivor of Hearth's Neighbor's inhabitants. They had crashed onto our planet and lived here until the end of their days.

LONELY HERMIT
-Hearth's Neighbor's sole planet. The surface is devoid of life.
-I found some kind of elevator that went below the surface and emerged in a strange expansive area. Is this planet bigger on the inside?

POWER PLANT
-There is a strange domed structure on the surface of Lonely Hermit.
-There does not seem to be a way inside. Judging by the copious amounts of Ghost Matter leaking out of it, it may not be a good idea to go inside it regardless.
-A mural indicates that this structure is built around a comet that once crashed into the planet. The planet's inhabitants harnessed a power from within the comet to fuel their civilization.

NORTHERN WASTELAND
-At the north pole, there are small remnants of civilization

EXTINCT VOLCANO
-A long-extinct volcano exists on the surface.

DEAD LAKE
-A strange structure exists surrounded by a moat. Despite the water, the area does not have any signs of life.
-The structure has some kind of landing/launching pad for larger ships. The pad is connected to a large hangar of some kind where the inhabitants of this planet stored resources to build a much larger structure.
-There is a massive locked door in the hangar.
-Behind the door was a floating satellite pointing at something in space. There is a signal coming out of it.

ALPINE CORE
-Below the Northern Wasteland, I found a strange land of frozen floating islands.
-On the largest island there is a building containing notes for infiltrating some kind of ship.
-There is a code on a piece of paper [Insert code here]
-The building contains a mural showing a red inhabitant somehow creating three pocket dimensions inside the planet.

LAVA CORE
-Below the Extinct Volcano, there is a cracked sphere with lava rising and falling.
-There is building with three locks.
[Note on each building]
-I found that there are some force fields that take the appearance of surrounding walls. These fields are harmless and can just be walked through. They are indicated with a symbol, hidden in plain sight.
-There is a mural showing three regions: an alpine, lava, and lake pocket dimension. These were initially highly productive, but quickly the dimensions grew unstable and fell apart.

LAKE CORE
-Below the Dead Lake, there is a strange sea dotted with a few islands. Next to the elevator that took me down is a levitating radio dish pointing north.
-There is a raft on the starting island.
-North of the starting island, there is a shrine of some kind on elevated ground. The stairs to the shrine have long crumbled.
-South of the starting island, there is a large landmass. It contains a tunnel.
-After going through the tunnel, I emerged at the surface. There is a gazebo with a mural on it. The mural seems to point out a tunnel below the water under a shrine.
-I found a way into the shrine through a tunnel under the water.
-There seems to be some kind of makeshift communications station in the shrine. There is a lever and a levitating radio dish pointing towards the entrance.
-The lever opened a door in the hangar at the Dead Lake.
-There is a mural in the shrine recounting a war between two factions, conveyed with red against blue inhabitants. This war lead to most of the planet becoming uninhabitable. Seeing this, the leaders of the two factions agreed to a truce and began to rebuild.
-A poster above the communications area displays blue inhabitants flying ships into space and slowly building a much larger ship.

DERELICT SHIP
-A lifeless ship hovers at the edge of the solar system.
-The ship has a red force field blocking its entrance. A panel nearby has various colored buttons on it.
-The ship is filled with Ghost Matter. It seems to still have minimal power, but it has no working engines.
-There is a room filled with various cryogenic pods. However, the inhabitants within them have all died.
-I found a way to the cockpit.
-On a screen in the cockpit, I received a damage report. The red inhabitants, left behind by the blue inhabitants, invaded their ship and blew up the engines with Ghost Matter. In defending the ship, the leader of the blue inhabitants killed the leader of the red inhabitants, but as they died, they triggered an even larger explosion that killed everyone left on the ship.
-After the damage report, the screen reported that the ship had received various transmissions. One of the ship's escape pods had managed to successfully launch. This pod landed on Timber Hearth. This survivor sent multiple messages into space requesting aid, but no help came. Eventually, the survivor accepted their fate and began simply sending messages as a sort of diary to anyone who might be interested.
