      <Page>Hi, I'm Lumine, an artist for the mod! Even if I got a lot of problems, I still managed to do my best, and I hope you will all like our work.</Page>
      <Page>We wanted to have way more illustrations in the mod, but due to the problems I had and the time limit, I couldn't make them.</Page>
      <Page>Even though the story is short, maybe I can continue it in other Mod Jams.</Page>
      <Page>It was a pleasure to participate to my first mod Jam ever, and I hope you enjoy playing the mod!</Page>
