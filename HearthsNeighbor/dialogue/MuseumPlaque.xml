      <Page>This is a strange, ancient metal plate found in the river in a grove near the village.</Page>
      <Page>Its origins are unknown; it is clearly not Nomai or Hearthian. Was there yet another civilization on Timber Hearth at one point? Unfortunately, this is the only trace of said civilization that has ever been found.</Page>
      <Page>The carving on the plate depicts our solar system and what seems to be our nearest system, Hearth's Neighbor. Could it have come from all the way over there?</Page>
      <Page>We long believed we would never know the answer, but due to recent Outer Wilds Ventures ships being equipped with a warp drive, this mystery may actually be solved one day!</Page>
