      <Page>Hi! I'm EndgameZero, the composer for Hearth's Neighbor.</Page>
      <Page>I had a lot of fun making the music for this mod, and I hope you enjoyed it.</Page>
      <Page>I especially liked writing parts that modified songs from the base game (The River but in 5/4 time was my favorite) and hiding secrets (can you hear any right now?).</Page>
      <Page>As this is my first mod jam (and my first mod in general): This song is new to me, but I am honored to be a part of it.</Page>
