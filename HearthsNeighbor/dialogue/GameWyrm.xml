      <Page>Hello! I'm GameWyrm, team lead and level designer. I also did all the garbage models in the mod.</Page>
      <Page>I hope you enjoyed Hearth's Neighbor! It's not the most complex, or polished of the Jam entries, I bet, but it's my desire that you at least had some fun playing it.</Page>
      <Page>We had a much more complex story and ending planned, but due to time constraints, we ended up cutting the more complex stuff.</Page>
      <Page>My desire for this mod was to create something different from most of the story mods that exist; I explicitly wanted to avoid doing a mod featuring Nomai or Owlks. This probably was a bad idea, since it did reduce the pre-made assets we could use and restricted us from using text to communicate to the player, but I hope the mystery surrounding this new race made up for the story's shortcomings.</Page>
