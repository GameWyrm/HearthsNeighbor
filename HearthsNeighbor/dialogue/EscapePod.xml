      <Page>[There's no mistaking it, this is the source of the museum's plate! It's been torn off the hull at some point, but this is defitely the same metal and paint.]</Page>
      <Page>[Judging by the structure, this is some kind of escape pod. It seems to be in a good shape, so the inhabitant(s) of it likely survived entry.]</Page>
      <Page>[Perhaps, one day, you can discover what happened to the survivors? It would have been very long ago, but, there's gotta be a chance.]</Page>
      <Page>[Congrats! You have completed the Jam version of Hearth's Neighbor (unless you managed find this early)! We wanted more after this, but time constraints required us to cut the ending short.]</Page>
      <Page>[Perhaps one day, we'll actually give this mod a full overhaul, with a proper ending, but no promises.]</Page>
      <Page>[...]</Page>
      <Page>[What, you want more? All right. Go back to where you learned about this pod, and look for a hidden tunnel. You can enter one side, but it's blocked. However, it goes all the way through to the other side...see if you can figure out where it ends up.]</Page>
